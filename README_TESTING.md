## Informal Development Testing

        Informal testing is and was conducted throughout the build.

        The informal process of testing is as follows:

        * Before code is written a new preview is opened
        * Line/lines of code written
        * Preview is opened and refreshed
        * Desired outcome is checked
        * Outcome is checked in a mobile phone layout using Chrome developer tools.
        * If outcome is successful then wider checks on other code are conducted. 
        For example, what impact does it have on other elements.
        * If outcome is unsuccessful then the line/lines of code written will be 
        checked and informal testing repeated.
        * Further testing including sending the website link to my partner who navigated 
        the website on both her phone and tablet.

## Build in Progress Bugs

        * Various issues with naming
        Due to a course break and a lack of initial understanding of the course
        material a lot of the python naming was incorrect and or incosistent that 
        lead to bugs that needed to be fixed with CI's help. This caused most of the 
        problems I had
        * Elements expanding outside of their container
                - Links in the profile cards had to be shortened due but this made
                the card look tidier anyway
                - Headers stretching the page when changing size
        * Forms not submitting correctly or at all
        * Materialize elements not changing size
        * Not being able to load the preview
                - After the course break I couldnt load the preview because heroku had 
                set the link to suspended
        * Losing the app.py file and other elements when opening a workspace
                - I had to work with CI to understand that workspaces exist and that I had
                to pin and reload each time - https://gitpod.io/workspaces
