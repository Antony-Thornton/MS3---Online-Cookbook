# User Story
## 2.1 The business case (Project Goals):

    This website has been designed to give the user the ability to record, ammend and view recipes online anywhere. The owner of the site is also looking to promote a brand of cooking utensils. The website owner would like to generate additional traffic to his website to help increase sales. In order to do so the site needs to have the ability to bring users back. This will be achieved by allowing the user to create and save recipes that they can access anywhere.


## 2.2 Wireframes

## Sitemap



## Mobile Wireframes

## Computer Wireframes




## 2.3 Website Objectives:



    * Promote a brand of cooking untensils
    * Allow the user to create a profile
    * Within this profile the user should be able to create and save their own recipes and the assoicated information
    * The user should be able to delete and edit recipes they have created
    * The user should be able to browse community approved recipes
    * The user should be able to log into their profile on any device and easily view their recipes



## 2.4 Design Inspiration

    The design inspiration came from the mini project in the code insitute course. I used a combination of https://materializecss.com/ and the template provided by the course to come up with the main structure for the site.

## 3.2 Features Left to Implement

    Star Rating system - I origionally wanted to add in a star rating system. I found some code online (See CSS file) but I wasnt well equipped enough to write the Python code to accomodate this so I have added this to the future learning points section.
